# wallet-api
## About
A REST (JSON) API that manages wallets of players in an online casino. The project is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), and uses [Gin]().
It has been built by implementing clean architecture and following the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern. This makes the project easy to maintain and extend. For testing, the architecture makes services easy to test.
